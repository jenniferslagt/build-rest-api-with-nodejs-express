# Build a REST API with Nodejs and Express (IN PROGRESS)


## Description
Hereby I'll learn how to build a REST API (CRUD) with Nodejs and Express!

#### What's a REST API?
Representational State Transfer (REST) which is an agreement / convention for building HTTP services. HTTP services are principles which provide support to Create, Read, Update and Delete data (CRUD). The data is on the server and the client can do a HTTP request with an endpoint to the server to get the wanted data.  

So every HTTP request has a method that determines its intention. We have GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. GET for getting the data. POST for creating something with the data. PUT for updating the data. DELETE for deleting data.


#### What's Nodejs?


#### What's Express?
Express is a fast and lightweight Node.js framework for building applications. It's actually a module (and only works on Node.js 0.10 or a higher version).

## Practices
* Node.js
* Express
* HTTP request methods (`get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `delete()`)
* Callback functions
* Nodemon package (restart app when file changes)
